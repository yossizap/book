# Rz-bin — Show Properties of a Binary

Rz-bin is a powerful tool to handle binaries, to get information on imports, sections, headers and other data. It can present this information in several formats accepted by other tools, including rizin itself.
rz-bin understands many file formats: Java CLASS, ELF, PE, Mach-O or any format supported by plugins, and it is able to obtain symbol import/exports, library dependencies, strings of data sections, xrefs,  entrypoint address, sections, architecture type.

 -j              output in json
 -k [sdb-query]  run sdb query. for example: '*'
 -K [algo]       calculate checksums (md5, sha1, ..)
 -l              linked libraries
 -L [plugin]     list supported bin plugins or plugin details
 -m [addr]       show source line at addr
 -M              main (show address of main symbol)
 -n [str]        show section, symbol or import named str
 -N [min:max]    force min:max number of chars per string (see -z and -zz)
 -o [str]        output file/folder for write operations (out by default)
 -O [str]        write/extract operations (-O help)
 -p              show physical addresses
 -P              show debug/pdb information
 -PP             download pdb file for binary
 -q              be quiet, just show fewer data
 -qq             show less info (no offset/size for -z for ex.)
 -Q              show load address used by dlopen (non-aslr libs)
 -r              rizin output
 -R              relocations
 -s              symbols
 -S              sections
 -u              unfiltered (no rename duplicated symbols/sections)
